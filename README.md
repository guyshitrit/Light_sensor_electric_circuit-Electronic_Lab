The product developed in this project is designed to provide feedback on lighting conditions using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor.
The sensor detects three distinct lighting scenarios, each indicated by a specific LED status:

Red LED (1): Indicates that the sensor is exposed to low light levels (darkness).
Yellow LED (2): Indicates that the sensor is exposed to high-intensity light.

No LED (3): Indicates that the sensor is exposed to ambient room lighting without any significant external light source.

Note to the user: If both LEDs are illuminated simultaneously, this signals a technical fault in the system.
